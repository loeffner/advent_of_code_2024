# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2024, implemented in Rust.

It's my first time using Rust, so this is both a learning experience and a challenge.

Feel free to explore, learn, or share feedback!

For each day, you can run:<br>
`cargo run` to generate the output for the solution.<br>
`cargo test` to run the tests (usually the small example in the description of the puzzle).<br>
`cargo bench` to get benchmarks for the relevant parts of the solution with random data.
